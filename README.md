1. I need to open to VSCode coz the backend will do some crazy thing and and create the instance folder outside backend folder.

# github repository frontend
https://github.com/carloscfgos1980/Amet-web-frontend.git

# github repository backend
https://github.com/carloscfgos1980/amet-website-backend.git

# I need to add .gitignore to the rooth tree of the app so I could update gitHub

# requirenmets.txt in backend is need for deploy. I just keep it here in order to not forget. I also needed to delet wincpy from requirements.txt coz it gave an error
